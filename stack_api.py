class Stack(LinkedList):
    '''
    A linked list implementation of a stack.
    
    This extends the LinkedList class, adding the typical stack methods to the class.
    In other words, this class uses "Inheritance" instead of "Composition".

        Pops an item from the stack.  This is done as follows:
            1. Get the last node in the list.
            2. Delete the node from the list.
            3. Return the value of the node.
